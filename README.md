# YouTubeRedirector
This is a simple firefox extension that redirects videos from their watch page to their embed page

This is mostly for myself as I tend to like  in-browser fullscreen over actual fullscreen. This allows you to click on the extension icon in your toolbar while watching a video. When clicked, it will redirect to the embedded version of that video. It does nothing else.
